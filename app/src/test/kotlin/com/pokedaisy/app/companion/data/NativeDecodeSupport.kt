/**
 * Shared helpers for the per-game Native*DecodeTest classes. Each game gets
 * its OWN test class (not shared test methods in one class) deliberately:
 * readNativeTelemetry's bag-read throttle (bagTick/bagValid/lastBag in
 * NativeReader.kt) is file-level mutable state, shared process-wide - fine in
 * the real app (one NativeConfig per running process) but it silently leaks
 * a PREVIOUS test's item list into the next one if multiple games' tests run
 * in the same JVM. build.gradle.kts sets `forkEvery = 1` on the test task so
 * Gradle restarts the JVM between classes, resetting that state - splitting
 * by class is what actually makes that isolation apply per-game.
