// regionMapSectionId will resolve through the shared Kanto mapsec table and

//
// Icons (2026-09-20): sItemIconTable (inherited from rev 0 above, 0x083D4294)

// grow (~930 species vs vanilla's ~412) and move - the inherited rev-0
// address's entries are all zeroed in Gaia's ROM, and a whole-ROM search for
// Bulbasaur's exact vanilla 1024-byte icon blob found no match, so there was
// no byte-content anchor the way gSpeciesNames' text strings gave one.
//
// Found it anyway, via the CODE instead of the data: pret's GetMonIconTiles
// (0x08097028), GetValidMonIconPalettePtr (0x080971cc) and
// GetValidMonIconPalIndex (0x080971f8) are still at their exact vanilla
// addresses in Gaia's ROM, byte-identical apart from (a) one patched immediate
// (the SPECIES_DEOXYS form-swap check's constant 205->255, since Gaia inserted
// ~100 species before it) and (b) their trailing literal-pool words, which
// naturally now hold Gaia's relocated table addresses instead of vanilla's -
// read those words directly and got monIconTable/monIconPaletteIndices/
// monIconPaletteTable below. Verified by decoding: species 1/4/25/150 (all
// redrawn-or-not Kanto starters+Pikachu+Mewtwo), 412/413-438 (Egg/Unown set,
// same run of shapes as vanilla), and 444 (Chimchar, in Gaia's Sinnoh block
// right after Unown) all render as the correct, recognizable sprite. Bulbasaur
// (species 1) confirmed genuinely redrawn as a regional variant (different
// colors/shape) - not a decode bug, Gaia just gave it new art while reusing
// vanilla's tile data unchanged for most other species (Charmander, Pikachu,
// Mewtwo, the Sinnoh block, etc. all matched vanilla's OWN tile addresses

// valid Gen3 struct Pokemon (PID^OTID key, PID%24 substruct order, 16-bit
// checksum) - unlike R.O.W.E./Heart and Soul, this DID validate with the
// stock checksum algorithm, so Lazarus keeps the vanilla struct layout (not
// a heavily-restructured expansion fork). Species 653 = Fennekin's
// *National Dex* number, confirming species is stored by National Dex
// index here (see speciesNamesNationalDex / SpeciesNamesNationalDex.kt), not the
// internal Gen3 index the shared table uses.
//
// playerParty: the first live scan found TWO byte-identical-looking copies
// of a valid party struct (0x0200e7a0 and 0x0201b960, 0xD1C0 apart) and an
// IWRAM pointer landing exactly party-0x238 before 0x0200e7a0 (0x238 =
// vanilla's own playerParty offset within struct SaveBlock1) looked like
// strong confirmation - it wasn't. A SECOND capture, taken later in the same
// session, showed 0x0200e7a0's personality/otId had changed while
// 0x0201b960's stayed byte-identical: 0x0200e7a0 was a one-off coincidental
// checksum match in transient/scratch memory (1-in-65536 odds aren't that
// long odds across a quarter-megabyte scanned every 4 bytes), and the IWRAM
// "confirmation" pointer was itself coincidental. Lesson: a single capture
// can't distinguish a real global from a lucky transient match - re-verify
// anything checksum-only against a second capture before trusting it.
// 0x0201b960 is the real address. playerPartyCount is at party-3 (NOT
// vanilla's party-4 - Lazarus's SaveBlock1 apparently doesn't have the same
// padding gap there), confirmed by the byte reading 1 in both captures.
//
// Bag was found independently of any SaveBlock1/party offset relationship
// (the two turned out not to share a simple fixed delta, implying Lazarus
// reordered SaveBlock1's fields, not just resized one) via a generic
// pattern search: scan every 4-byte offset in EWRAM for a run of 25+
// consecutive u16 "quantity" values sharing one nonzero value (the
// XOR-with-encryptionKey signature of a mostly-empty ItemSlot array) with
// exactly one differing entry nearby - that one entry is the user's real

// Emerald Seaglass v3.0 - BPEE, exactly 16 MB (so Poller.detect()'s >16 MB

// access; a pokeemerald-expansion-style recompile (mixed-case names, National
// Dex species numbering, expansion item order) with its own link layout -
// none of NATIVE_EMERALD's RAM addresses hold. Every field overridden below
// was found from HEADLESS captures (scripts/capture_fixture_headless.sh,
// no device) of the user's real save - 1 Torchic Lv5 + a Shiny Charm - and
// confirmed stable across 5 independent captures with different boot timing
// (so different RNG seeds, so a different SaveBlock offset each time -
// Emerald's per-load save-block relocation):
//   - playerParty: checksum-valid mon at 0x02019C20 in all 5; the only other
//     hit (0x0200CBxx) drifted every capture and sits at exactly
//     gSaveBlock1Ptr+0x238 (vanilla's SaveBlock1.playerParty) - it's the
//     save-block copy, not the global. Count byte at party-3, like vanilla.
//   - saveBlock1Ptr/saveBlock2Ptr: the IWRAM pair that always points at that
//     drifting copy (-0x238) / at a SaveBlock2 whose name reads "LIDOR".
//     encryptionKey stays at vanilla's +0xAC: every empty bag slot's
//     quantity is exactly key&0xFFFF in all 5 captures.
//   - gMain: the only IWRAM pair counting exactly the captured frame deltas
//     (vblankCounter1/2 at +0x20/+0x24, vanilla offsets); callback1/2 are
//     stable Thumb ROM pointers.
//   - bagPockets: stable {ptr,cap} x5 table whose pointers track SaveBlock1
//     (+0x560 cap 80, +0x740 cap 20, +0x790 cap 70, +0x8A8 cap 60, +0x6A0
//     cap 40) - vanilla Emerald's pocket order; the Shiny Charm (a key item,
//     id 691 in ItemNamesSeaglass.kt) sits in pocket 4.
//   - mapHeader: stable, mapsec 0x00 (Littleroot) + MAP_TYPE_INDOOR while
//     SaveBlock1 says map 1.4 (Birch's Lab) - vanilla Hoenn mapsec ids.
//   - objectEvents: gObjectEvents[0] = the player (currentCoords = SaveBlock1
//     pos + 7), stable; the drifting 0x0200D4xx hit is SaveBlock1's copy.
// NOT found (no battle in any capture): battleMons/battlerPositions/
// battlersCount/battleTypeFlags are still NATIVE_EMERALD's - known wrong,
// same gap as Lazarus/Emerald Rogue - and expansion's struct BattlePokemon
// likely isn't vanilla's layout either, so decodeBattleMon would need a
// variant regardless. Touch-battle-input addresses zeroed so that stays
// cleanly disabled, same as Heart and Soul.
//
// Icons (ROM data, found by static analysis of the ROM file - no RAM
// involved): expansion has no gMonIconTable/gMonIconPaletteIndices/
// gItemIconTable arrays; the same fields live inside each fixed-stride
// gSpeciesInfo / gItemsInfo entry, so the bases below point at the field
// within entry 0 and the strides are the whole structs' sizes:
//   - gSpeciesInfo: 0xD0-byte entries (inline species names are exactly
//     0xD0 apart - "Bulbasaur"@0x088F087C, "Ivysaur" +0xD0, "Torchic" at
//     species 255). Relative to the name: +0x4C = iconSprite (raw 1024-byte
//     4bpp, the only per-species pointer whose target isn't LZ77 - the
//     neighbours are front/back pics and palettes), +0x5A = iconPalIndex in
//     the low 3 bits (upper bits: iconPalIndexFemale).
//   - gMonIconPaletteTable: still a separate array (0x0893F0B8 - the only
//     place in ROM with six {ptr, tag 56000..56005} entries).
//   - gItemsInfo: 0x54-byte entries, name-relative +0x34/+0x38 = iconPic/
//     iconPalette (every item's pair points at LZ77 data decompressing to
//     exactly 288/32 bytes = a 24x24 icon + palette).
// Verified by decoding offline with these exact rules: species 1-60,
// 252-311, Mewtwo, Rayquaza, Pecharunt all render as the right Pokémon in
// the right colours; balls, Potion, Mint, Gengarite and the user's Shiny
// Charm all render correctly as items. Species Seaglass doesn't include
// (e.g. #445) and TMs (expansion draws TM discs per move type in code) have

// Battle (2026-10-07, headless - the emerald_seaglass_battle fixture: a scripted

//   reader of gMonIconPaletteIndices now holds (0x08096EC0, 0x080970D8, ...).
//   Vanilla's 0x083D3E80 was used at first and looked right on the one icon
//   checked (Tepig's index is 0 in both), but 757 of the 1268 species differ.
// - monIconTable: MOVED. GetMonIconTiles's own vanilla rev-0 address
//   (0x08097028) still holds byte-identical CODE (only the per-species
//   tile-graphics DATA relocated, unsurprising given ~1267 species now vs.
//   vanilla's 411 means the old table's space was long outgrown) - its
//   trailing literal pool now holds 0x09C018FC instead of vanilla's own

//   three of these addresses end-to-end and it rendered as a real,
//   recognizable two-frame Pokémon icon - not a guess, visually confirmed.
// - itemIconTable: MOVED, to 0x083DB028. Vanilla rev 0's GetItemIconGfxPtr
//   (0x08098974, address obtained by building the pinned pokefirered commit
//   completely unpatched in the project's own Docker image - confirmed
