/**
 * Every translation table, one per area of the app (each file `Tr<Area>.kt`).
 * Entries are `"ENGLISH" to Tr(ja = ..., fr = ..., de = ..., it = ..., es = ...)`,
 * one per line in that field order - scripts/check_translations.py parses them.
 *
 * House style: keep the English's casing (the UI is mostly ALL CAPS, like the
 * games' menus) and its `{0}` placeholders; use the localized games' own
 * words (BAG = SAC / BEUTEL / BORSA / MOCHILA / バッグ); Japanese in kana
 * only, like Gen 3's Japanese text; stay about as short as the English -
 * the buttons and tab chips are sized for it.
