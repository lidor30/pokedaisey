/**
 * Bridge for the bottom-screen SETTINGS tab: lets the player tweak settings
 * from Screen-2 without leaving the game. Implemented by PokeDaisyActivity,
 * which also live-applies changes to the running
 * [com.pokedaisy.app.EmulatorEngine] / touch-controls visibility,
 * not just persisting them to [com.pokedaisy.app.Prefs].
 *
 * Key/button rebinding here is a TAP-A-NAME-FROM-A-LIST picker, not "press the
 * button you want" — the Presentation on Screen-2 never receives physical
 * `KeyEvent`s (those go to the main Activity on the top screen), so there's no
 * way to capture a live keypress there. Picking from a list only needs touch,
 * which Screen-2 gets fine. Only single-key bindings are settable this way
 * (chords stay a top-screen-Settings-only feature).
