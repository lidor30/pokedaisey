/**
 * Where a Gen 1 song loops (the Game Boy twin of [M4aLoopWatch]), read from the sound
 * engine while it plays on the render core: the music channels' state - command
 * pointers, call return addresses, note delay and loop counters - fully decides what
 * plays next, so the first frame it repeats an earlier frame's state, the song has come
 * round. (The tempo's fractional carry is left out: it only nudges a note by a frame.)
 * A state that stops changing altogether means the song ended (a fanfare).
