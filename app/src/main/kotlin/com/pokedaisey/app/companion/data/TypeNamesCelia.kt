// Pokemon Celia's Stupid Romhack v1.1.4's type names, extracted directly
// from the ROM: FireRed-style 7-byte gTypeNames at 0x0873A5DC (5 code refs),
// 34 ids. Custom order - Steel is 4, Ground 13, Fire 14 - plus joke types
// (Brock, Weird, Dad, Choco, Large, Bird, Small, Sound) and duplicates
// (Water 8/15, Electric 9/17, Psychic 10/18, Fighting 1/33). ROM spellings
// are ALL CAPS abbreviations (FIGHT/ELECTR/PSYCHC); expanded/title-cased
// here so the UI's per-type colours apply. The duplicate-named slots 8-10
// are real, distinct types (own chart rows; no species, but a few moves -
// Fire Punch is type 8 "Water"). 11 is drawn with glyphs ("?"),
// 12 is the Mystery slot ("???", skipped by typeMatchups), 27 is blank.
