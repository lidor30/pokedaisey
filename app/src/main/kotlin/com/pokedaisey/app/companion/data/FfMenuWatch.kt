/**
 * Whether the game has a menu screen up - party, bag, summary, PC, Pokédex,
 * options... - so SMART fast-forward ([com.pokedaisey.app.companion.FfMode])
 * can drop to 1x there, in battle too (its bag and party screens).
 *
 * Every Gen 3 game, decomp or binary hack, runs the field and battles each on
 * one fixed `gMain.callback2` (CB2_Overworld, BattleMainCB2), while each of
 * those screens switches to its own - even when opened from a battle
 * (checked headless on Emerald Rogue: field, party, bag, battle all differ;
 * the START menu and dialogue are overlays that keep the field's). So no
 * per-game menu table is needed, only two addresses per ROM, which are
 * learned, not looked up:
 *  - `gMain` itself: the detected game's own address when it has a native
 *    config ([useKnownGMain]); otherwise the IWRAM word pair at +0x20/+0x24
 *    (vblankCounter1/2) that advances exactly with the frames between two
 *    snapshots, beside ROM pointers at +4 (callback2) and +0xC (the VBlank
 *    callback) ([locate]). Either way it is re-checked every [VERIFY_GAP]
 *    frames: a counter that stops moving means the address is wrong (a task's
 *    frame counter once passed for FireRed's, and its slot's function pointer
 *    then read as "a menu" on the field and as "the field" in real menus), so
 *    it's dropped with whatever was learned through it and found again.
 *  - the field's callback2: the one running whenever the player has moved
 *    ([notePosition]); the battle's: the one running most while `inBattle`.
 * Both are remembered per ROM ([load] / [onLearned]), so a menu is caught
 * from the first frame on the next launch.
