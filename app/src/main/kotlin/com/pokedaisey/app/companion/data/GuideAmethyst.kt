/**
 * Pokémon Amethyst's guide: WHERE IS from its area data (gen_guide_areas_rom.py),
 * NEXT BOSS for the gyms whose scripts battle a fixed trainer (FireRed's badge
 * flags, 0x820..). Every team comes in four versions - the game's trainer
 * loader picks a table by HARD MODE and the DIVERGENT Pokémon set (see
 * [GUIDE_TABLES_AMETHYST]) - so all four are listed. The third and fourth
 * gyms can be taken in either order: RAINE's script picks her team by the
 * badges you hold (2, 3, 4: trainers 105, 256, 257), CHANCE's by 3 or fewer
 * vs 4 (154, 258), counted by a native routine (0x088FB3D9) the scripts also
 * use for the level cap. CASEY's two ids differ only by the player's gender (same
 * team). The eighth gym and the League load their trainer from a var at run
 * time, so they aren't listed. Places are the region map's names.
