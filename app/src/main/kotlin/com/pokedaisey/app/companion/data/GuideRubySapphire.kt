 * Ruby and Sapphire's guide - one text, built per version. Every fact was

 * (data/maps/…/scripts.inc) for where things are given and what a gate
 * checks, and src/ for the rules (badge -> HM in pokemon_menu.c, obedience in
 * battle_util.c, rematches in battle_setup.c, the braille puzzles in
 * braille_puzzles.c, the roamer in roamer.c). Where they differ from
 * Emerald: the villain team follows the version (TEAM MAGMA in Ruby, TEAM
 * AQUA in Sapphire - the scripts' VAR_OBJ_GFX_ID_1 grunts), the eighth gym is
 * WALLACE's and the champion STEVEN, the SOOTOPOLIS crisis ends in the CAVE OF
 * ORIGIN, HM07 lies there, STEVEN hands out HM08 on your first visit, the
 * fossils are in the ROUTE 111 desert, the REGI puzzle is different, and
 * there's no MIRAGE TOWER, BATTLE FRONTIER or JOHTO starter gift.
