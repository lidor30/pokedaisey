/**
 * The FF-music cache key: the song the game's background-music player is
 * really playing, read from the m4a sound engine every Gen 3 game and hack
 * shares - so wild / trainer / gym battles, surfing, cutscenes all get their
 * own clip, for any game, with no per-game song table to get wrong (a
 * hand-picked "battle song" once made FireRed play Emerald's trainer theme).
 *
 * `SOUND_INFO_PTR` (0x03007FF0) -> SoundInfo; its `musicPlayerHead` chains
 * every MusicPlayerInfo through `musicPlayerNext`, newest first. m4aSoundInit
 * opens the BGM player first, so it's the tail. Its `songHeader` - a ROM
 * pointer - is the key (clips are cached per ROM, so it's stable).
