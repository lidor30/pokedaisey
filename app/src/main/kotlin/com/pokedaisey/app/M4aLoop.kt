/**
 * Where a song loops, read from the m4a sound engine itself while it plays on
 * the render core (FfMusicRenderer) - not guessed from the audio. Every Gen 3
 * song's tracks end in a GOTO back to their loop start (after any intro), so
 * the BGM player's first track jumping backwards through a GOTO marks the
 * loop's end, and the frame its stream first ran past the GOTO's target marks
 * the start. A song that loops from its very first note started before the
 * watch did, so for it the period is taken between two GOTOs instead.
 *
 * (An earlier audio-only detector compared the first 2 s of a recording with
 * later audio: on battle themes, which repeat a bar every few seconds, it cut
 * clips to ~3 s, and it always looped back to the intro.)
 *
 * Offsets from pokefirered's include/gba/m4a_internal.h (shared by every
 * agbcc-built game and binary hack): MusicPlayerInfo.trackCount +0x08,
 * .tracks +0x2C; MusicPlayerTrack (0x50 bytes) .flags +0x00, .patternLevel
 * +0x02, .cmdPtr +0x40, .patternStack[0] +0x44.
